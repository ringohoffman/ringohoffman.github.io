## What I do

I am a research engineer at [Protopia AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/protopia%E2%80%94ai/posts/?feedView=all). At the moment I work almost exclusively in Python, mostly on our PyTorch SDK and model training framework. I've also worked on a real-time face recognition pipeline. You can check out <a href="/matthewhoffman_resume.pdf">my resume</a> if you'd like to learn more about what I've worked on.

I enjoy design, problem solving, and the creative process. I tend to understand and build things from the bottom up. I am a talented debugger and a passionate advocate for Python typing and my favorite static type analysis tool, [pyright](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/).

Outside of work, I enjoy taking long walks around San Francisco, trying new restaurants and cafes, and identifying plants.

## What is this blog?

My goal for this blog is to share my knowledge with other Python enthusiasts looking to improve the code they write and the way they develop. I hope this blog can be something you find useful on your own Python journey.
