### What I do

I am a research engineer at [Protopia AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/protopia%E2%80%94ai/posts/?feedView=all). At the moment I work almost exclusively in Python, mostly on our PyTorch SDK and model training framework. I've also worked on a real-time face recognition pipeline. You can check out <a href="/matthewhoffman_resume.pdf">my resume</a> if you'd like to learn more about what I've worked on.

Design is the core of my craft as an engineer. Each solution brings the implicit challenges of efficiency, usability, maintainability, and scalability. It is through the application of design principles, adherence to best practices, and the utilization of the proper tools that I am able to create effective, adaptable software.

### What is this blog?

My goal for this blog is to create an in-depth technical reference for other Python enthusiasts looking to improve the code they write and the way they develop it. I hope this blog can be something you come back to time and again on your own Python journey.
